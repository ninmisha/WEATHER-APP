This weather app allows users to search for the current weather of any city using the OpenWeatherMap API. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app provides a sleek user interface featuring a search bar, dynamic weather updates, and relevant icons based on the weather condition. It displays key weather data like temperature, humidity, and wind speed, while adapting its icon according to the weather (e.g., rain, clouds, snow). Users can easily interact with the search function, and if an invalid city name is entered, an error message is shown. The app is responsive and designed with modern styling, utilizing a clean, minimalistic layout. Error handling is also integrated, ensuring a smooth user experience. This project showcases the ability to fetch and display real-time data from an external API while enhancing front-end design with responsive CSS. Itâ€™s a great starting point for learning JavaScript and working with APIs.
